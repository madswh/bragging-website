<p class="intro">This is my first website. I learned this from a combination of YouTube and trial-and-error, very late at night.
Below, you will find links to my GitHub and LinkedIn pages, plus a PDF of my full resume. 
In 2023, I graduated from the University of Puget Sound with my BS in Chemistry; 
currently I am studying Software Design and Engineering at the University of Washington.
